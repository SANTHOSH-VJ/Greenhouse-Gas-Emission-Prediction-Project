Supply Chain Emissions Modeling Using Industry and Commodity Data (2010–2016)
Problem Statement:

You have annual supply chain emission data from 2010–2016 categorized into industries and commodities. 
The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.).
